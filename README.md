To view on your own computer, clone down and run via your local host:

- If you would like to fork the repository so you have your own copy, feel free to!
- Click on the green "Code" button.
- Copy either the HTTPS or SSH link that is provided (SSH is preferred)
- Open up the Terminal and navigate to the desired directory location
- Once inside, use the code "`git clone` copied_link_here"
- Once the repo has been installed, change into the directory with `cd zox-faq-skillz`
- From here you can run `code .` to open it up in VS Code

> To open in your browser, run `npm start` and that will open up the browser to 'localhost:3000'
