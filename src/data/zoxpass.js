        <p>
          With an active monthly subscription status to our Mystery Pack, Pearl
          Club, or String Club.

          If you already were holding an active subscription at the time of the
          launch (December 15th, 2021) then you would automatically be a part of
          ZOXPASS, no need to sign up for another subscription or for ZOXPASS
          itself.

    question: `Can I combine my ZOXPASS discount with other discounts?`,
    answer: (

        <p>
          Sadly you are unable to stack discounts on our site. So if any
          discounts are applied at checkout, the automatic ZOXPASS discount will
          be removed.
