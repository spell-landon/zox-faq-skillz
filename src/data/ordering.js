        question: 'Can you make me a personalized ZOX?',
        answer: `I'm so sorry but at this point in time we can not offer personal ZOX. We totally understand there are certain meanings or designs that you or loved ones are drawn to. Please be sure to check out our Shop page and you may just be able to find something similar to what you're looking for.\nIf you have an idea for a ZOX design, please join ZOX Idea Factory and post it in there. We have a ton of amazing artists who are always looking for new ideas.`,

        question: `Why won't my discount apply to my order?`,
        answer: `1. You cannot use multiple discounts at the same time.\n2. Some discounts only apply to specific items and will not apply if the item is not in your cart.\n3. You have already used the discount on a previous order so it is no longer valid.\n4. You can not discount subscriptions as they process through a separate platform for checkout.\nWe hope this helps! :) `,

        question: `Help, I ordered the wrong item! What should I do?`,
        answer: `I'm so sorry to hear that! If you reach out to us quickly enough via live chat or the contact form at the top of this page we will try our best to adjust that order in time.\nUnfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the adjustments before the order ships out due to the high volume of messages we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We will give it our best efforts though! :)`,
