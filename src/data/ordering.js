    question: `Why won't my discount apply to my order?`,
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>1. You cannot use multiple discounts at the same time.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2. Some discounts only apply to specific items and will not apply if
          the item is not in your cart.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          3. You have already used the discount on a previous order so it is no
          longer vapd.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4. You can not discount subscriptions as they process through a
          separate platform for checkout.

          Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the

          We do everything we can to get orders processed and shipped out as
          soon as they come in, which is usually 1-3 business days but it may
          take up to 4-6 days if we have a large influx of orders.

          to a friend and we'll give you a full refund on it. If you have
          additional unworn Straps, Imperials or Strings you'd like to return
          within 15 days of purchase, you can fill out the return form at the
          bottom of this page and we'll get you taken care of right away.

          Unfortunately when an order is over 90 days old, our system is then no
          longer able to issue a refund. If there are any issues that exceed
          that timeframe such as orders not being delivered, damaged items, etc.
          we will not be able to issue a refund but will instead need to issue
          you a store credit for your the initial amount that was paid.
