    question: `What are straps/singles made of?`,
    answer: (

        <p>
          ZOX are buttery-soft elastic wristbands made made from recycled
          plastic water bottles!

          Though the latex is typically not visible (each strand of latex is
          encased in polyester), you may experience discomfort if you're
          allergic to latex. In that case, we'd recommend collecting our
          imperial+ or metlets which are latex-free.

        <p>
          It depends on the collection type! The rarity level will show under
          'Details' on the product page. Every strap/single we make is limited
          edition, so once it is fully sold out, it is gone for good.

            Certain chemicals coming into contact with the elastic such as bug
            spray or sun spray and oils and lotions can cause the elastic to
            warp.

    question: `Can I get my ZOX wet?`,
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          You sure can! Zox are made of a special type of elastic that holds up
          very well in water; even after getting 'em wet the color will be super
          vibrant and awesome. We do definitely recommending ordering the ZOX to
          fit as well as possible Once in a while we see Straps that are in
          water non-stop, or ZOX that are too large get a little warped, as
          elastic tends to do over time, but unless you're a fish you probably
          have nothing to worry about. If you are a fish and have learned how to
          read, I'd love to hear from you! üôÇ

    question: `Why didn't my strap come with a golden ticket?`,
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          If you do not receive a golden ticket with a gold stitched strap
          (#001-100), we did not forget it and there was not any sort of mistake
          on our end. Golden tickets have only been added in for the past couple
          of years and older gold stitched straps will not come with them.

            Some items may also not include golden tickets, such as blog straps
            and monster month.
