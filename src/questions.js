        question: `Why won't my discount apply to my order?`,
        answer: `1. You cannot use multiple discounts at the same time.\n2. Some discounts only apply to specific items and will not apply if the item is not in your cart.\n3. You have already used the discount on a previous order so it is no longer valid.\n4. You can not discount subscriptions as they process through a separate platform for checkout.\nWe hope this helps! :) `,

If you reach out to us quickly enough via live chat or the contact form at the top of this page we will try our best to adjust that order in time.\nUnfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the adjustments before the order ships out due to the high volume of messages we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We will give it our best efforts though! :)`,
